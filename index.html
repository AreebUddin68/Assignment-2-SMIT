    <h1>Cake Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients of Cake:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>4 egg</li>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps Of Making Cake:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Cream together butter-sugar and then blend with beaten eggs <br />
        Making a homemade sponge cake was never so easy. Begin by mixing sugar
        and butter together. Whisk well until light and fluffy with a manual
        whisker or a fork. Once done, add the beaten eggs and blend well. Beat
        further so that the mixture turns white and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour mix and beaten eggs <br />
        Sift together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. It is done to
        evenly distribute the baking soda in flour. Gradually, add this to the
        egg mixture. If required, add a little milk and mix till the batter is
        fluffy and soft. You may not add the entire milk if you feel the
        consistency of your cake is fine and it pours down like canned condensed
        milk. Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla essence is important
        to camouflage the smell of eggs and to make the cake taste delicious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the cake as per your convenience <br />
        Now, take a baking tin to cook the cake and grease it well using some
        butter or cooking spray. Then, sprinkle some maida or all-purpose flour
        on it. It will prevent the cake from sticking to the base. You can also
        line it with butter paper so that when the cake is baked, it can be
        taken out easily. Pour the prepared cake batter into the prepared tin
        and place it on a stand in a pressure cooker. Do not add water to the
        cooker and ensure that the tin does not touch the base of the cooker.
        You can also keep the baking dish on an inverted steel plate. Increase
        the flame and pressure cook for two minutes. Now, remove the whistle and
        cook on low flame for 35-40 minutes. If you are using an electric oven,
        cook at 180 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check with a knife or skewer if it is cooked and serve <br />
        Insert a knife or a metal skewer into the cake and if it comes out
        clean, then the cake is ready. Remove from the oven/cooker and allow to
        cool on a wire rack. This cooling process is done so that the cake
        doesn't break down in between and comes out nice and clean. Once cooled
        enough, turn the cake tin upside down to remove the cake. You can also
        use the butter paper to lift off the cake, but you have to be a pro to
        make it happen quickly as it can also break the cake. So, it's better to
        turn the tin upside down for a better cake. Before decorating, cut an
        even slice of the cake from the top to prevent any doomed top. But make
        sure you do this step when the cake is still warm and not completely
        cold. Now, take some whipping cream and line the cake with it evenly and
        scrape any extra cream. Once done, you can use cherries to decorate the
        cake or even tutti-frutti, it completely depends on your choice. The
        cake is ready now.

        How to make whipping cream <br />
        To make whipping cream for a cake at home, all you need is a mixing
        bowl, some heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and an
        electric mixer. Take the bowl and add heavy whipping cream in it along
        with powdered sugar and vanilla extract in it. Whip them all together at
        medium-high speed. One must understand here that it should not be
        overdone. If the cream comes out grainy and curdled, it's a hint that
        you have over-whipped the cream. The soft whipping cream will be done in
        a few minutes, say about 2-3 minutes. Make sure to stop in between and
        check the consistency of the whipping cream. The perfect whipping cream
        will have a sturdy peak in it when lifted off. It should not be too soft
        or liquidy, and curdled or heavy. Once done, you can transfer in a cone
        as well to decorate your cake.

      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For making Homemade Cake, make sure you whisk the cake mix well. And
          better use an electric blender for mixing all the ingredients, as this
          will make the mixture frothy and light.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not have butter at home, you can even use clarified butter
          or ghee. Or you can use homemade white butter for extra flavour.
